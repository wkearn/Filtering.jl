Currently, the following algorithms have been implemented

- Kalman filter
- Kalman smoother
- Auxiliary particle filter
- Forward-backward particle smoother
- Score filter of Nemeth et al. (2017)

These are sufficient for most of my own applications at the moment. Additional filtering techniques, in particular ensemble Kalman filtering, may be useful in the future. 

The first order of business is to clean up the package, making sure that syntaxes match across the various algorithms.
